  <p>You grab your knife and shout "HARAMBE WAS AN INSIDE JOB!" before sprinting into the group of eyes and slashing wildly.
    Squeals surround you and you rip through what seems to be small dogs. You hear footsteps running away and you slump down tired.
    You pull out your phone to reveal two dead jackals lying on the ground around you. You turn to JaMarcus to tell him you're ok
    but realize he is face down on the ground. You run over turning him over where he groans covering his chest. You remove the hand over his chest
    only to see that he has been both bitten, and stabbed accidently during the chaos.
     What do you do?</p>
