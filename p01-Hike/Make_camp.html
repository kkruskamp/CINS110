  <p>You attempt to create camp.
    By gathering wood and leaves you created makeshift beds for you and JaMarcus.
    You cannot make a fire, but are able to skin the surround jackal and eat some of its meat raw.
    The next morning you wake up sick and unable to walk. JaMarcus has passed and you are unable to go any further.
    You have died.</p>
